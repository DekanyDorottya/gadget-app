## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a web server to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can use a local development server or host the files on a web server of your choice. The project is designed to work with a backend server that provides gadget data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Start a web server to serve the HTML file. You can use tools like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you are using Visual Studio Code.

3. Make sure you have a backend server running:
 ```shell
   npm i
   node server.js
   ```
5. Access the website through your web server, and you can start browsing gadgets, adding them to your cart, and placing orders.
